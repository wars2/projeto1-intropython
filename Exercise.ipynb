    "\n",
    "The Breit-Wigner distribution can also be expressed in the following form:\n",

It is now your task to figure out which the values of the maximum of the distribution $M$ and the full width at half maximum of the distribution $\\Gamma$ could approximately be. The histogram that was created earlier will help in this task.\n",

    "After running the code Jupyter will print the values of the different parameters as a result of the optimization. Also uncertainties of the values and a graph of the fitted function are printed. The uncertainties will be received from the covariance matrix that the fitting function `curve_fit` will return."

    "    From the histograms one can see that the events where the pseudorapidity of both of the muons have been small, will produce more narrow peak than the events with the muons with great pseudorapidities. That means that the resolution of the invariant masses have been worse with the great pseudorapidities.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The worse resolution follows from the fact that the resolution of the transverse momentum (p_t, the component of momentum that is perpendicular to the particle beams) has been worse for the muons with great pseudorapidities. This can be seen for example from the image 21 on page 32 of the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.4071.pdf of the CMS Collaboration.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The explanation for the effect of the pseudorapidity to the resolution is that the particles which head to the endcap of the detector (great pseudorapidities) will more probably interact with the material of the detector than the muons with smaller pseudorapidities (check the image 11). In these interactions muons will lose some of their energy. This messes up slightly the fitting of the trajectories of the muons and the measurement of the transverse momentum. It also effects to the situation that the measurement of the transverse momentum is easily depended for example from the orientation of the muon chambers, from the division of the material of the detector and from the magnetic field. It can be assumed that these things are worse known for the particles that have great pseudorapidities.\n",
